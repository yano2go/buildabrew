Even without dumbing things down the basics of brewing are fairly easy. You take a quantity of some kind of starch, usually grain, mix it with water and if conditions are right it will ferment and Brewing processMashing it up
form a primitive sort of beer, and that is all there is to it. Today it is all a bit more scientific of course, but the principle is the same. 
<br /><br />
Basic Brewing
While much of the present day commercial brewing process follows traditional lines, the need for product consistency has made some very precise procedures necessary. Brewing processMicro brewery
It all begins with the malting of the barley. First, the barley grains are steeped for two or three days.
Steeping is the alternate moistening and drying of the grains to prepare them for germination. The moistened barley is then laid out on the floor at roughly room temperature for between four and six days.
This stage is brought to an abrupt halt by raising the temperature to about 65ºC in a process known as 'kilning'. The temperature and duration of the kilning will determine the colour and flavour of the malt and consequently the beer.
<br /><br />
Once this is all done, the grains are malted. The malted grains are then mashed. First the grains are crushed before being poured into a large vessel - the mash tun - with hot water at 55ºC. In Belgium a mix of different types of malt is generally used, sometimes using wheat, wheat malt or other cereals. The temperature is gradually raised to about 75ºC to activate the enzymes that will convert the starch into sugars and the Brewing ProcessDoing it manually
proteins into amino acids. The resultant mash is then filtered through the malt husks that have settled at the bottom of the mash tun.
This process is known as 'lautering' and the resulting liquid is now known as wort. The residual grain is no longer needed and is generally used for animal feed. The wort goes into a large tank known as 'a copper' where it is boiled with hops or whatever else is being used to flavour the finished beer. At this stage many chemical reactions take place and it’s when the brewer can make important decisions about the finished beer’s flavour, colour and aroma. After boiling for a predetermined period, the wort is then rapidly cooled.
<br /><br />
Top or Bottom?
Next comes the fermentation process, when the sugars in the wort are transformed into carbon dioxide and alcohol. There are three types of fermentation involving different strains of yeast. Brewing process Modern brewing
Spontaneous fermentation uses only wild yeasts and other bacteria in the air. No additional yeast is added.
This type of fermentation is traditionally practised in the 'Pajottenland' region of Belgium southwest of Brussels, an area famous for its Lambiek beers.
<br /><br />
High or Top Fermentation yeasts are active between 15ºC and 25ºC. During fermentation the yeast floats on the surface, hence 'Top Fermentation'. This is the oldest form of prepared yeast fermentation and the majority of specialist and regional beers are still made this way. These beers are usually ready to drink about three weeks after the beginning of fermentation, although some brewers will condition them for several months or years.
<br /><br />
The Bottom or Low Fermented process was discovered by accident in the 16 th century after beer had been stored in cool caverns for long periods. The process was largely ignored until the Bavarians revived it towards the end of the 19 th century and it was subsequently perfected in Bohemia, before arriving in Belgium. In this process the yeasts perform at their best at fermentation temperatures between 6ºC and 10ºC, so it’s necessary to have some means of cooling the wort. Fermentation takes longer and the yeast sinks to the bottom of the vessel. These beers also take longer to mature, which is why this type of beer acquired the name “lager” from the German word meaning 'to store or keep'. This clear golden beer rapidly caught on, particularly on mainland Europe where “pils” became almost a staple drink. Today the vast majority of beers are of this type. Obviously production using Bottom Fermentation is far more costly than the simpler Top Fermentation method and many small breweries that couldn’t afford to change to the new brewing process gradually went out of business.
The popularity of lager inevitably led to the growth of large commercial breweries.
